Created using Python, infrared LEDs, and a pair of small cameras, the method involves using Open Computer Visionâ€™s libraries to calculate the position of the pupil utilizing Hough Circle Transforms. Once this has been completed, the remaining camera is used as an environment camera, mapped from the pupil location data based on a bivariate polynomial that is formulated from calibration methods from multiple instances of use of the software. As the amount of users and the time used increases, as does the accuracy of the detection and mapping. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n### Eye Tracking Costs \r\n\r\n### How Does it Work?\r\nThe code utilizes a library known as Open Computer Vision which has the ability of analyzing individual video frames as well as, even more specifically, individual intensity values of each pixel. By manipulating and analyzing these intensity values, circles can be extracted from image frames. Once the circular shape of the iris is confirmed, the center can be generalized as the position of the pupil. Once the tracking is completed, the movement of the center point is related to the movement of the actual gaze. \r\n\r\n### Hough Circle Transform\r\nThe main process used for localizing the circle of the iris in the image plane, Hough Circle Transforms are a simple additive detection method based on probability of location. Essentially, a circle is defined as a polar coordinate, a direction rho and an angle theta. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
