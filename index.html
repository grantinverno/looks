<p>In this research a novel method for minimizing the processing necessities, hardware necessities, and cost of interactive eye tracking based on computer vision is proposed. Created using Python, infrared LEDs, and a pair of small cameras, the method involves using Open Computer Visionâ€™s libraries to calculate the position of the pupil utilizing Hough Circle Transforms. Once this has been completed, the remaining camera is used as an environment camera, mapped from the pupil location data based on a bivariate polynomial that is formulated from calibration methods from multiple instances of use of the software. As the amount of users and the time used increases, as does the accuracy of the detection and mapping. </p>

<a id="how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-it-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How Does it Work?</h3>

<p>The code utilizes a library known as Open Computer Vision which has the ability of analyzing individual video frames as well as, even more specifically, individual intensity values of each pixel. By manipulating and analyzing these intensity values, circles can be extracted from image frames. Once the circular shape of the iris is confirmed, the center can be generalized as the position of the pupil. Once the tracking is completed, the movement of the center point is related to the movement of the actual gaze. </p>

<p>The main process used for localizing the circle of the iris in the image plane, Hough Circle Transforms are a simple additive detection method based on probability of location. Essentially, each edge point that can potentially be part of a circle is mapped in another plane as a circle with its center at that coordinate. Once all the points are mapped, the point with the maximum number of intersections is most likely the center of a detected circle. </p>
